Developer, geek, dyslexic, linux fanboy, coffee hipster/addict and with a mix of the typical accent
of an Italian immigration neighborhood of São Paulo, the largest city in Brazil.

Bachelor degree in Computer Science by University of São Paulo I've been working in the area
since 2012 (time of my early internships). Despite being curious and passionate about technology
I maintain my ambiguous relation of "**Yikes, what a delight!**" with IT in the classic battle of
managing expectations, focus and frustration.

## Eugenio A. Jimenes

Developer, geek, dyslexic, linux fanboy, coffee hipster/addict and staunch leftist - CallMarx, get
it?

Bachelor degree in Computer Science by University of SÃ£o Paulo. I've been working in the area
since 2012. Despite being curious and passionate about technology I maintain my ambiguous relation
of "**Yikes, what a delight!**" with IT in the classic battle of managing expectations, focus and
frustration.
